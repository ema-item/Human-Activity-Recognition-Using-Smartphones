Human Activity Recognition Using SVM
This code implements a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using smartphone sensor data. It employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel to classify six activities: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying.

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. The model achieves an impressive 99% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing activities. The confusion matrix provides detailed insights into the model's performance for each activity.

This project is a foundation for building real-time HAR systems and can be extended with advanced models or hyperparameter tuning for further improvements.
